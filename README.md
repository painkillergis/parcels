# parcels

Parcels is a webapp for navigating public and private county tax parcels. It's also a playground for learning React, canvas, WebGL, and other webapp/mapping technologies.

## High-Level Direction

We should be able to easily find the Crow Wing River hidden campsite using this app. This project is forked from Lattice (cell phone tower game) and already has some canvas/navigation basics. It would be a great start to symbolize public vs private parcels and show the user's location.
